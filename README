	Kilo LISP is a small interpreter and REPL for purely symbolic
	LISP. Its source consists of 25K bytes of comprehensible
	code (20KB C + 5KB LISP) and it runs in 64K bytes of memory.
	None the less it offers:

	- lexical scoping
	- tail call elimination
	- macros
	- quasiquotation
	- variable-argument functions
	- constant-space garbage collection
	- image files
	- keyboard interrupt handling

	The code should compile with any C89 (K&R2/ANSI/ISO) C compiler.
	It even compiles with Turbo C 2.0 or SubC (http://t3x.org/subc/)
	and with K&R (pre-ANSI) C when using unproto. It does not use
	any stdio functions and compiles to a static executable of

	29K bytes using SubC on FreeBSD x86-64
	13K bytes using Turbo C on DOS (8086)
	11K bytes using Mark Williams C on Coherent 3.2 (80286)
	512K bytes using GCC on FreeBSD x86-64 (LOL)

	Depending on the amount of memory you can spare, you may want
	to adjust the NNODES variable in kl.c. 1 node = 5 bytes. A
	reasonable minimum is 8192 nodes (when compiling to a single-
	segment 16-bit file). This is also the default. The maximum is
	32760 nodes.

	Language-wise, Kilo LISP is a LISP-1 using tail recursion to
	implement iteration. It is a bit like Scheme, but using more
	LISPy syntax and function names (NIL, T, LABELS, NCONC, ...)
	See the manual (klisp.txt) for details.
